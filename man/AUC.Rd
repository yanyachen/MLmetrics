\title{Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC)}
\usage{
AUC(y_pred, y_true)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_pred}{Predicted probabilities vector, as returned by a classifier}

\item{y_true}{Ground truth (correct) 0-1 labels vector}
}
\value{
Area Under the ROC Curve (ROC AUC)
}
\description{
Compute the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) from prediction scores.

\examples{
data(cars)
logreg <- glm(formula = vs ~ hp + wt,
              family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = mtcars)
AUC(y_pred = logreg$fitted.values, y_true = mtcars$vs)
